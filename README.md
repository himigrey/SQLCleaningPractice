# SQL Cleaning - Practice
A simple data cleaning and management project utilizing SQL and SSMS.
-
The original datset contained inconsistencies and gaps in information, such as missing addresses and multiple terms to represent similar responses (i.e. 'Y' and 'Yes' were both in use),
as well as issues with data types (strings instead of numeric values)
With the use of SQL, the data was cleaned and made consistent through the use of various queries and table updates, as well CASE and a few window functions, such as ROW_NUMBER().
SQL code and original dataset are available here.
